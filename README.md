### Programs created by me during my learning and Python programming courses. 

[English](README.md) | [Русский](README-ru.md)


## Application

You can integrate these programs as separate modules into a business project to expand functionality.

### Caesar Cipher

**Description:**

The program encrypts the entered text according to the Caesar cipher. You can choose the direction of the shift and the number of shifts.
The program encrypts text in two languages: English and Russian.

### Number Systems

**Description:**

The program converts numbers from various number systems into the selected one.
You can choose the number system from which the number is converted and the one to which the number is converted.
If an invalid number system is chosen, the entered number will be converted to the decimal number system.

### Guess the Number

**Description:**

The user enters an interval, and the program randomly selects a number within that interval.
The user has 5 attempts to guess the number. The program provides hints in the form of "higher" or "lower" text output.
After guessing or running out of attempts, the program offers to restart.

### Magic 8-Ball

**Description:**

The program asks the user to enter their name and greets them.
Then, it asks the user to enter a closed-ended question that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no."
The user receives random responses typical of a real Magic 8-Ball.

### Password Generator

**Description**

The program generates random passwords based on selected settings. You can specify the number of generated passwords.
You can also choose character settings for each generated password.
